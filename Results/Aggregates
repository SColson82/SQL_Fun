-- 02 Aggregate functions
-- world.db
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Country;
-- Counts the non null values in the column
SELECT COUNT(Population) FROM Country;
-- Aggregate function, this query gives aggregate of all the population data in the table. 
SELECT AVG(Population) FROM Country;
---AVG function can operate on aggregated data. This query gives the average population of each region with non null values. 
SELECT Region, AVG(Population) FROM Country GROUP BY Region;
SELECT Region, MIN(Population), MAX(Population) FROM Country GROUP BY Region;
SELECT Region, SUM(Population) FROM Country GROUP BY Region;

-- 03 DISTINCT Aggregates
-- world.db
-- Counts the number of non null rows in the column
SELECT COUNT(HeadOfState) FROM Country;
-- Checking the data you see that many Heads of State are duplicated. 
SELECT HeadOfState FROM Country ORDER BY HeadOfState;
-- Using the Distinct constraint will give the Heads of State list with no duplicates.  
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT HeadOfState) FROM Country;
